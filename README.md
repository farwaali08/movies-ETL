# movies-ETL

## OVERVIEW

In this project, an automated **ETL**<sup>1</sup> pipeline was created to read, clean, condense, and load various data into an existing postgreSQL database.

Raw was sourced from the following locations: files scraped from Wikipedia, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data. The data was extracted using Python, cleaned and formatted in Python, and then stored in a PostgreSQL database.
